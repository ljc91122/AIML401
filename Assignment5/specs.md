1. Implement three basic sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort in ascending order.

They will be implementyed by functions:

```
def bubble_sort(arr): #arr is a python list
```

```
def selection_sort(arr): #arr is a python list
```

```
def insertion_sort(arr): #arr is a python list
```

2. Implement nlog(n) complexity sorting algorithms: merge sort and quick sort in ascending order and recursicve fucntions.

```
def merge_sort_main(arr): #arr is a python list

def merge_sort(arr, low, high): #resursive

def merSubArray(subarr1, subarr2):

```


```
def quick_sort_main(arr): #arr is a python list

def quick_sort(arr, low, high): #resursive
# pick a pivot and reposition it using partition()

def partition(arr, low, high):
#choose the pivot as arr[low]
#reposition pivot
#return pivot position
```
